The plan involves creating a Typer CLI application with the following components:

1. `requirements.txt`: A file listing the dependencies required for the project, specifically including the 'typer' library.
2. `star_box.py`: The main script that implements the Typer CLI application. It contains the main function that takes two integer arguments, x and y, and prints a box of stars with the specified dimensions.
3. `star_box_logic.py`: A separate file containing the business logic for generating the star box. This file includes a function that takes two integers and returns a list of strings, each representing a row of the star box.

This architecture is viable as it separates the CLI interface from the business logic, making the code modular and easier to maintain.
