There are no apparent problems with the provided code snippets. Both scripts should work as intended. Here is a brief explanation of each:

1. `star_box.py`:
   - This script uses the `typer` library to create a command-line interface.
   - The `main` function takes two integer arguments, `x` (width) and `y` (height), and prints a box of stars with the specified dimensions.

2. `star_box_logic.py`:
   - This script defines a function `generate_star_box` that takes `width` and `height` as arguments.
   - It returns a list of strings, each string representing a row of stars, forming a box with the specified dimensions.

Both scripts are logically correct and should function as expected. If you encounter any specific issues or errors when running these scripts, please provide more details.
